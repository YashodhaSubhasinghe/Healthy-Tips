Skin care habits that can help clear acne

Are you faithfully treating your acne but still seeing new breakouts? Your skin care routine could be to blame. 
Here are 10 skin care habits that dermatologists recommend to help you get the best results from your acne treatment:

Wash twice a day and after sweating. Perspiration, especially when wearing a hat or helmet, can make acne worse, so wash your skin as soon as possible after sweating.

Use your fingertips to apply a gentle, non-abrasive cleanser. Using a washcloth, mesh sponge, or anything else can irritate the skin.

Be gentle with your skin. Use gentle products, such as those that are alcohol-free. Do not use products that irritate your skin, which may include astringents, toners and exfoliants. Dry, red skin makes acne appear worse.

Scrubbing your skin can make acne worse. Avoid the temptation to scrub your skin.

Shampoo regularly. If you have oily hair, shampoo daily.

Let your skin heal naturally. If you pick, pop, or squeeze your acne, your skin will take longer to clear and you increase the risk of getting acne scars.

Keep your hands off your face.Touching your skin throughout the day can cause flare-ups.
