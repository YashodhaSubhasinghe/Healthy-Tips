      <h3>Skin care habits that can help clear acne</h3>
      <h4>Are you faithfully treating your acne but still seeing new breakouts? Your skin care routine could be to blame. Here are 10 skin care habits that dermatologists recommend to help you get the best results from your acne treatment:</h4>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li class="tips"><b>Wash twice a day and after sweating.</b> Perspiration, especially when wearing a hat or helmet, can make acne worse, so wash your skin as soon as possible after sweating.</li>
        <li class="tips"><b>Use your fingertips to apply a gentle, non-abrasive cleanser.</b> Using a washcloth, mesh sponge, or anything else can irritate the skin.</li>
        <li class="tips"><b>Be gentle with your skin.</b> Use gentle products, such as those that are alcohol-free. Do not use products that irritate your skin, which may include astringents, toners and exfoliants. Dry, red skin makes acne appear worse.</li>
        <li class="tips"><b>Scrubbing your skin can make acne worse. </b>Avoid the temptation to scrub your skin.</li>
        <li class="tips"><b>Shampoo regularly.</b> If you have oily hair, shampoo daily.</li>
        <li class="tips"><b>Let your skin heal naturally.</b> If you pick, pop, or squeeze your acne, your skin will take longer to clear and you increase the risk of getting acne scars.</li>
        <li class="tips"><b>Keep your hands off your face.</b>Touching your skin throughout the day can cause flare-ups.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Hair Care Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="tips"><b> Wash Your Hair Regularly.</b>Washing your hair regularly ensures that your scalp and hair is free of dirt and excess oil. However, the right frequency depends on your hair type and personal preferences. If you have extremely dry hair, limit your washing to twice a week. If you have an oily scalp, washing your hair on alternate days can help.</li>
        <li class="tips"><b>Use Chemical Free Shampoos</b>    You really can’t control all the environmental factors that damage your hair, but what you can control is the kind of shampoos you use. Lesser the number of chemicals in your shampoo, healthier your hair. Go for gentle shampoos that suit your hair type.

          Sulfates and parabens in shampoos are used for lathering and preserving respectively, but they can cause skin irritation over time and increase the risk of hormonal disruptions.    </li>
        <li class="tips"><b>Drink More Water.</b>   We will go on repeating ‘you are what you eat’ as long as we write about hair care and skin care. Your hair is made of proteins and amino acids. It needs the right nutrition to grow well and maintain itself. Eggs, berries, nuts, fish, green leafy vegetables, sweet potatoes are some of the many great foods for healthy hair.</li>
        <li class="tips"><b>Eat Healthy.</b>Internal hydration coupled with external hydration is the key to well-balanced and healthy hair. You may be using hydrating hair care products and oils, but drinking at least 3 litres of water everyday ensures good hair health.</li>
        <li class="tips"><b>Use A Wide-toothed Comb.</b>   Wet hair is fragile and prone to breakage. Let your hair dry and then use a wide-toothed comb to brush your hair. This kind of a comb prevents damage to your hair.     </li>
      </ul>
