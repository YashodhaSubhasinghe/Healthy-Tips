      <h3>1. Fill up on Fiber.</h3><br>
      <p>Fiber is found in healthy foods including vegetables, fruits, beans and whole grains.

        Some studies have shown that simply eating more fiber-rich foods may help you lose weight and keep it off.
        Increasing your intake is as easy as adding beans to your salad, eating oats for breakfast or snacking on fiber-rich nuts and seeds.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Bring out Your Inner Chef.</h3><br>
      <p>Cooking more meals at home has been shown to promote weight loss and healthy eating. 
        Although eating meals at restaurants is enjoyable and can fit into a healthy diet plan, focusing on cooking more meals at home is a great way to keep your weight in check.

What’s more, preparing meals at home allows you to experiment with new, healthy ingredients while saving you money at the same time.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h3>3. Have a Protein-Rich Breakfast.</h3><br>
      <p>Including protein-rich foods like eggs in your breakfast has been shown to benefit weight loss.
        Simply swapping your daily bowl of cereal for a protein-packed scramble made with eggs and sauteed veggies can help you shed pounds.

Increasing protein intake in the morning may also help you avoid unhealthy snacking and improve appetite control throughout the day.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>4. Stay Hydrated.</h3><br>
      <p>Drinking enough water throughout the day is good for overall health and can even help you maintain a healthy weight.

        One study of over 9,500 people found that those who were not adequately hydrated had higher body mass indexes (BMIs) and were more likely to be obese than those who were properly hydrated.
        What’s more, people who drink water before meals have been shown to eat fewer calories.
      </p>

      <h3>5.  Practice Mindful Eating.</h3><br>
      <p> Practice Mindful Eating.
        Focusing on eating slowly and enjoying your meal, even if you have limited time, is a great way to reduce overeating.
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>6. Lift Heavier to Get Lighter.</h3><br>
      <p>Although aerobic exercise like brisk walking, running and biking is excellent for weight loss, many people tend to focus solely on cardio and don’t add strength training to their routines.

        Adding weight lifting to your gym routine can help you build more muscle and tone your entire body.
        
        What’s more, studies have shown that weight lifting gives your metabolism a small boost, helping you burn more calories throughout the day, even when you are at rest.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>7. Avoid Fad Diets.</h3><br>
      <p>Fad diets are promoted for their ability to help people lose weight fast.

        However, these diets tend to be very restrictive and not easy to maintain. This leads to yo-yo dieting, where people lose pounds, only to gain them back.
        
        While this cycle is common in those trying to shape up quickly, yo-yo dieting has been linked to a greater increase in body weight over time.
        Additionally, studies have shown that yo-yo dieting can increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome.
        These diets may be tempting, but finding a sustainable, healthy eating plan that nourishes your body instead of depriving it is a much better choice.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>8. Eat Whole Foods.</h3><br>
      <p>Keeping track of exactly what is going into your body is a great way to get healthy.

        Eating whole foods that don’t come with an ingredient list ensures that you are nourishing your body with natural, nutrient-dense foods.
        
        When purchasing foods with ingredient lists, less is more.
        
        If a product has lots of ingredients that you are unfamiliar with, chances are it is not the healthiest option.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>9. Be Realistic.</h3><br>
      <p>Comparing yourself to models in magazines or celebrities on TV is not only unrealistic — it can also be unhealthy.

        While having a healthy role model can be a great way to stay motivated, being overly critical of yourself can set you back and may lead to unhealthy behaviors.
        
        Try focusing on how you feel rather than concentrating on how you look. Your main motivations should be to get happier, fitter and healthier.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>10. Find Workouts You Actually Enjoy.</h3><br>
      <p>The great thing about choosing a workout routine is that there are endless possibilities.

        While sweating through a spin class might not be your cup of tea, mountain biking in a park might be more up your alley.
        
        Certain activities burn more calories than others. However, you shouldn’t choose a workout based solely on the results you think you’ll get from it.
        
        It’s important to find activities that you look forward to doing and that make you happy. That way you are more likely to stick with them.</p>
